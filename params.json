  "body": "# scrabble-tiles\r\nThis is a Sass-based library of responsive Scrabble tiles that can be used as a font on your web site/web app.\r\n\r\nTo use the library you will need the following:\r\n\r\n* Ruby - https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\r\n* Sass - http://sass-lang.com/\r\n* NodeJS - https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node\r\n* A build tool of your choice (Grunt is included with this library to get you started - http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)\r\n\r\n1. Install Ruby, Sass, NPM and the Grunt CLI on your machine.\r\n2. Clone this repo: https://github.com/theonicolaou/scrabble-tiles\r\n3. Navigate to the root of the folder you have cloned into and check you have Grunt installed:\r\n\r\n\t```grunt -v```\r\n\r\n4. Then, type:\r\n\r\n\t```npm install``` (this will install all the required Grunt modules)\r\n\r\n5. Then, type:\r\n\r\n\t```grunt develop``` and this should start up a local server at port 8888 with a demo page of the Scrabble tiles.\r\n\r\n# How to use\r\n\r\nMake sure your HTML page has a reference to the CSS file:\r\n\r\n``` <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/styles.css\"> ```\r\n\r\nUse the following markup for a standard tile:\r\n\r\n```<div class=\"scrabble-container\">\r\n\t<span class=\"scrabble-tile__letter\">A<span class=\"scrabble-tile__number\">1</span></span>\r\n</div>```\r\n\r\nYou can rotate the tile using one of these classes:\r\n\r\n```scrabble-tile__rotate-nw``` or ```scrabble-tile__rotate-ne```. The amount of rotation can be set in the _variables.scss Sass partial.\r\n\r\nThere are also some other utility classes available:\r\n```scrabble-tile--end-letter``` applies margin-right to the tile.\r\n\r\n```scrabble-tile--end-letter__mobile-only``` applies to 768px and up.\r\n\r\n```scrabble-tile__new-word``` applies a ```clear: both``` to the tile so that the next tile starts on a new line.\r\n\r\n```display--inline-block``` displays the word in the center of the screen (useful for short words that look odd when aligned left)",
